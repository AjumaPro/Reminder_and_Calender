# Alarm Sounds

Place your alarm sound file here as `alarm.mp3`.

## Requirements:
- Format: MP3
- Filename: alarm.mp3
- Size: Keep under 1MB for better performance

## How to add:
1. Copy your MP3 file to this directory
2. Rename it to `alarm.mp3`
3. The app will automatically use this file for alarms

## Default:
If no alarm.mp3 is found, the app will use the system default alarm sound.
