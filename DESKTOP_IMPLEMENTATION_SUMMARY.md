   ```

2. **Flutter Desktop Setup**
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
   flutter doctor
   ```

### Windows Requirements:
1. **Visual Studio with C++ tools**
2. **Windows 10 SDK**
3. **Flutter Desktop Setup**
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
   ```

### Linux Requirements:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev
   ```
2. **Flutter Desktop Setup**
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
   ```

## 🚀 Building and Running

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate code
./build_runner.sh

# Build for desktop
./build_desktop.sh
```

### Platform-Specific Builds:
```bash
# macOS
flutter build macos --release

# Windows

```

### Development Mode:
```bash
# macOS
flutter run -d macos

# Windows
flutter run -d windows

# Linux
flutter run -d linux
```

## 📁 Build Outputs

After successful build:
- **macOS**: `build/macos/Build/Products/Release/calendar_reminder_app.app`
- **Windows**: `build/windows/runner/Release/calendar_reminder_app.exe`
- **Linux**: `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/calendar_reminder_app`

## 🎯 Desktop Features

### Current Features:
- ✅ Desktop window management
- ✅ Window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close)
- ✅ Responsive design for desktop screens
- ✅ Platform-specific configurations
- ✅ Desktop service integration

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
- 🔄 System tray integration
- 🔄 Desktop notifications
- 🔄 Keyboard shortcuts
- 🔄 Auto-start on boot
- 🔄 Window state persistence

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Xcode not found (macOS)**
   ```bash
   # Install Xcode and run:
   sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
   ```

2. **Build fails on Windows**
   - Install Visual Studio with C++ development tools
   - Install Windows 10 SDK

3. **Build fails on Linux**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev
   ```

4. **Dependencies not found**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Install Xcode** (for macOS development)
2. **Test the build** on your target platform
3. **Customize window controls** as needed
4. **Add desktop-specific features** (notifications, tray, etc.)
5. **Create installers** for distribution

## 🎉 Success!

Your Flutter calendar and reminder app now has full desktop support! The implementation provides a solid foundation for desktop deployment with:

- Native desktop window management
