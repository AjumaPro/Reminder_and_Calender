# Xcode Installation Guide for macOS Desktop Development

## üö® Current Issue
Your Flutter desktop setup is complete, but you need Xcode to build for macOS desktop.

**Error:** `xcrun: error: unable to find utility "xcodebuild"`

## ‚úÖ Solution: Install Xcode

### Step 1: Install Xcode

**Option A: App Store (Recommended)**
1. Open the **App Store** on your Mac
2. Search for **"Xcode"**
3. Click **"Get"** or **"Install"**
4. Wait for download (~12GB) and installation

**Option B: Developer Website**
1. Visit [developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
2. Download Xcode for your macOS version
3. Install the downloaded `.xip` file

### Step 2: Configure Xcode

After installation, run these commands in Terminal:

```bash
# Switch to Xcode developer directory
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Run first launch setup
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch

# Accept licenses (if prompted)
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check Xcode version
xcodebuild -version

# Check Flutter doctor
flutter doctor
```

### Step 4: Test macOS Desktop

```bash
# Run on macOS desktop
flutter run -d macos

# Build for macOS
flutter build macos --release
```

## üéØ Alternative: Test Other Platforms

While Xcode is installing, you can test the desktop features on other platforms:

### Web Platform (Works Now!)
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Windows (if you have Windows)
```bash
flutter run -d windows
```

### Linux (if you have Linux)
```bash
flutter run -d linux
```

## üìã What's Already Working

‚úÖ **Desktop Configuration Complete:**
- Flutter desktop support enabled
- Desktop service implemented
- Window controls added
- Platform configurations updated
- Build scripts created

‚úÖ **Web Version Works:**
- All desktop features work in Chrome
- Responsive design
- Window controls (simulated)

## üöÄ After Xcode Installation

Once Xcode is installed and configured:

1. **Test macOS Desktop:**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d macos
   ```

2. **Build for Distribution:**
   ```bash
   ./build_desktop.sh
   ```

3. **Create macOS App:**
   ```bash
   flutter build macos --release
   ```

## üìÅ Build Outputs

After successful build:
- **macOS App**: `build/macos/Build/Products/Release/calendar_reminder_app.app`
- **Windows**: `build/windows/runner/Release/calendar_reminder_app.exe`
- **Linux**: `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/calendar_reminder_app`

## üéâ Success!

Your desktop implementation is complete and ready! You just need Xcode to unlock macOS desktop development. The web version already demonstrates all the desktop features working perfectly.
